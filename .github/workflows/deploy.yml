      # DEPLOYMENT STEP
      # The build artifacts are now ready.
      # You would add your deployment script here.
      #
      # Example for GitHub Pages:
      # - name: Setup Pages
      #   uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      # - name: Upload artifact
      #   uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
      #   with:
      #     path: ./out
      # - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      #   id: deployment
      #   uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
      #
      # Example for a traditional server (using scp):
      # - name: Deploy to Server
      #   uses: appleboy/scp-action@master
      #   with:
      #     host: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}
      #     username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USERNAME }}
      #     key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}
      #     source: "out/*"
      #     target: "/var/www/my-app"
      # =================================================================
